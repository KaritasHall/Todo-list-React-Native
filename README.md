# Todo-list app with React Native :tulip:


This is a simple todo list application that I made with the goal of getting familiar with the basics of React Native. The user can add and delete a task.
While working on the project I had simulators running both in ios and android. The only real difference I found was that the Button component works
differently on these platforms (see comments). React Native also has it's own accessibility labels that I used.
